Problem Statement
You have a list of Event objects, each containing:
eventName (String)
startTime (Integer) → Time in 24-hour format (e.g., 1330 for 1:30 PM)
endTime (Integer) → Time in 24-hour format (e.g., 1530 for 3:30 PM)
Sort the events based on:
Primary Sort: By startTime in ascending order.
Secondary Sort: If two events have the same startTime, sort by endTime in ascending order.
Tertiary Sort: If both times are equal, sort by eventName in alphabetical order.
