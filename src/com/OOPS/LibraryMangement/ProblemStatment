Problem Statement: Library Management System
Objective: Design and implement a Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Requirements:
Classes and Objects:
Create a class LibraryItem with attributes title, author, and publicationYear.
Create subclasses Book and Magazine that inherit from LibraryItem.
Inheritance:
Book should have an additional attribute genre.
Magazine should have an additional attribute issueNumber.
Polymorphism:
Override the displayInfo() method in both Book and Magazine to display their specific details.
Encapsulation:
Use private attributes in the LibraryItem class and provide public getter and setter methods.
Abstraction:
Make LibraryItem an abstract class and include an abstract method displayInfo().
Interface:
Create an interface Borrowable with methods borrowItem() and returnItem().
Implement the Borrowable interface in the Book and Magazine classes.
Composition:
Create a class Library that contains a list of LibraryItem objects.
Provide methods in the Library class to add, remove, and display all items.
Aggregation:
Create a class Member with attributes name and memberId.
Establish an aggregation relationship between Library and Member where a library can have multiple members.
Association:
Create a class Librarian with attributes name and employeeId.
Establish an association between Librarian and Library where a librarian manages a library.
Static Members:
Create a static variable totalItems in the Library class to keep track of the total number of items in the library.
Increment totalItems whenever a new item is added to the library.
