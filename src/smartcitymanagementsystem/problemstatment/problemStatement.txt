problem Statement: "Smart City Management System"
Description:
Develop a Smart City Management System that manages various city services like citizen records, traffic control, waste management, water supply, and emergency services using Core Java concepts.
Core Java Topics Covered:
OOPs (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
Create classes like Citizen, TrafficService, WasteManagement, WaterSupply, and EmergencyService.
Encapsulation: Keep citizen details private and expose only necessary information through getter/setter methods.
Inheritance: Citizen can be extended to Resident and Tourist.
Polymorphism: Different implementations of processRequest() for various services.
Abstraction: Define an interface CityService with methods like provideService().
Collections Framework
Use ArrayList to store citizen details and service requests.
Use HashMap<String, Integer> to track available resources (e.g., police vehicles).
Use Queue to manage emergency requests in order of priority.
Exception Handling
Handle scenarios like "Invalid Citizen ID", "Service Not Available", or "Traffic Violation Detected".
Implement custom exceptions like ServiceNotAvailableException.
Multithreading
Implement multiple threads to manage simultaneous activities like garbage collection, water supply, and emergency response.
Use synchronization to prevent conflicts when multiple services try to access shared resources.
File Handling
Store and retrieve citizen details, service requests, and complaints using BufferedReader and BufferedWriter.
Use serialization (ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream) to save/load city data.
Lambda Expressions & Stream API
Use streams to filter citizens based on age or service requests.
Apply lambda expressions for sorting service requests based on priority.
